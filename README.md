# MSc in Statistics and Machine Learning at Linköping University

This repository contains all the projects and laboratory works carried out during the courses studied at the MSC in Statistics and Machine Learning at Linköping University.

The contents are separated by courses, each one of them contained in a different folder.

# Courses

## Advanced Academic Studies

It contains a report that I wrote about "Equal opportunities in the context of higher education in Europe".

## Advanced Programming in R

It contains 7 different laboratory assignments carried out using R and GitHub. Some of the tasks were creating an R package on GitHub and Travis CI, implementing a Shiny application or connecting to a web API using R.

*All those assignments where performed together with my class collegue Martin Svensson (@MiniDlicius on GitHub).

## Computational Statistics

It contains the course literature book, Computational Statistics by James E. Gentle. Also, two assignments related to linear algebra or maximizing the likelihood function, among other things. They were carried out using R.


## Machine Learning

It contains two books that were included in the course literature. 

There are five different projects. In each folder, it is written what the content is about. Some examples of the algorithms and techniques implemented are: EM algorithm, k-NN, Adaboost, Random Forests, Decision Trees, LDA, PCA, SVM and Kernel Methods.

The HelpFile.pdf file is a document that incorporates all the laboratory works plus the lecture notes.


## Multivariate Statistical Methods

It contains two books that were included in the course literature. 

The "Seminars' Exercices" folder contains mathematical exercises (paper-based)

The "Assignment0X" folders contain computer-based assignments.
